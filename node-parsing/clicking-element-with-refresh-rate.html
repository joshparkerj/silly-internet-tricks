  <marquee>You know, there's a big world out there filled with desperate orphans who would gladly swim across an ocean
    of thumbtacks just to be eclipsed by the long shadow that is cast by my accomplishments. But I don't care about
    them. I chose to open my heart to you two loverly children and your hideous primate. All I ask in return is that you
    do each and every thing that pops into my head while I enjoy the enormous fortune your parents left behind.
